\chapter{Mission Timeline Encoding}\label{app:DRMencoding}

At each step (every new target observation) of a mission simulation, the following values are recorded:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Target number (based on arbitrary ordering of the whole target list)
\item Arrival time (seconds after mission start)
\item Spacecraft mass on target arrival (kg)
\item Detection status (-2 = False Positive, -1 = False Negative, 0 = True Negative, 1 = True Positive)
\item Detection integration time (s)
\item Detection stationkeeping $\Delta V$ (m/s) 
\item Detection stationkeeping fuel mass (kg)
\item Planet sky angle at time of detection (mas)
\item Planet $\Delta$mag at time of detection
\item First distance spectrum status (boolean: 0 = Failure, 1 = Success)\footnote{First distance refers to the first separation distance for MDOs.  For coronagraphs, this is the only spectrum taken.}
\item First distance spectrum integration time (s)
\item First distance spectrum stationkeeping $\Delta V$  (m/s)
\item First distance spectrum stationkeeping fuel mass (kg)
\item Characterization slew $\Delta V$ (m/s)\footnote{Only for MDOs - refers to the slew between the different separation distances.}
\item Characterization slew fuel mass (kg)
\item Second distance spectrum success (boolean)
\item Second distance spectrum integration time (s)
\item Second distance spectrum stationkeeping $\Delta V$ (m/s)
\item Second distance spectrum stationkeeping fuel mass (kg)
\item Slew time to next target (s) \footnote{Constant for coronagraphs.}
\item Slew $\Delta V$ to next target (m/s)
\item Slew fuel mass to next target (kg)
\item Slew angle to next target(rad)
\item Lateral disturbance force at first distance separation (N)
\item Axial disturbance force at first distance separation (N)
\item Lateral disturbance force at second distance separation (N)
\item Axial disturbance force at second distance separation (N)
\end{enumerate}
